4A Integration
===================

AVIRT has been integrated with [4a-softmixer](https://github.com/iotbzh/4a-softmixer)
and [4a-hal-generic](https://github.com/iotbzh/4a-hal-generic) to provide a smooth
transition from the existing aloop implementation to the future AVIRT loopback implementation.

### User-space Library

The user-space library [libavirt](https://github.com/fiberdyne/libavirt) can be used to configure AVIRT from within a given AGL 4A binding.

### Softmixer

The AVIRT loopback can be used in-place of the standard aloop module. Modifications are currently underway
to port the current 4a-softmixer to the new AVIRT loopback.

### Hardmixer

A new 4A mixer controller plugin (`.ctlso`) has been developed to demonstrate the capabilities of the
Fiberdyne DSP mixer operating on the HiFi2 core on-board the Renesas R-Car M3 M3ULCB
AGL reference platform. This is called the '**hardmixer**', and is a faster, lower
latency alternative to the softmixer.
